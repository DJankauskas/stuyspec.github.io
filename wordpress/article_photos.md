# Article Photos

Look through those other folders that you’ve got and try and match up images with articles. It’s not always easy, and sometimes you have to go back if you’ve missed one.

Usually, it’s as simple as hitting “Set featured image” and adding the image author as the caption (for photo, it’s usually in the image name; for art, apparently they are of one mind, and need no creditation).

[I just added a photo of the Big Sibs in this one as an example, please make sure the images actually correlate with the articles.]

If the image is of the author or is incredibly low quality, sometimes it’s better to insert directly into the text of the article. Let me know about those ones and I’ll handle ‘em.
