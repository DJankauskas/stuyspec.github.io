# Logging Into Spec
Once you’ve got all that taken care of, head over to stuyspec.com. This should be your favorite website, and if it isn’t, death by pancakes. (But in all seriousness if it’s not your favorite website I totally understand because it’s not mine either.)

1. Log in by clicking on that little person symbol in the right corner there. I call him The Login Coroner, because “coroner” looks like “corner” (and in his free time he works for the NYPD). Screen
2. Then login. I’m not telling you my password.
