# Article Content

1. After that nightmare, you’ll need to paste in the content. So, y’know, do that.
2. Now, sometimes copy/paste pulls a weird one, so look through the article and make sure all the formatting is okay. Everything should be aligned against the left side of the screen, no indents; no extra lines between paragraphs; we don’t underline different sections, we bold them; and make sure Word doesn’t add in any comments or stuff that the editors put in there. We had a really awkward situation where an editor sent a link to an article that had a strange Word comment right smack in the middle and we had to do an emergency article revision in class. It’s a pain, so just make sure none of that happens before we get in a bad situation.
