# Article Tittle & Author

At this point, you should open up one of those documents you’ve got there. Some of this stuff should be pretty self-explanatory.

1. For example, the title goes in the title spot: ScreenScreen
2. Authors are tricky, at the moment. Go ahead an’ copy that name (and included email address, if it’s there). Screen
Now, you might notice that author dialogue underneath the Post box, and your name should be in it.
3. Now obviously, you didn’t write this article (probably), so go ahead and try typing in the author’s name. Anyone on the site that has an account will show up, like our wonderful EIC Lev Akabas. Screen
4. If an account doesn’t show up for the author, then just set it to admin, and then do the next set of italicized steps. [NOTES: If there are just multiple authors, add them. If there are authors and something like “With additional reporting by…” just do the italicized steps. If it’s a Staff Ed, the author will be “The Editorial Board.” Things without authors are just admin.] Screen
5. Go to “Screen Options” up at the top and make sure “Custom Fields” are shown. Screen
6. In the Custom Fields box underneath the Authors box, set the field to “author,” paste in that author name and email, and make sure that you add the field. This will tag the author on and we can add them later when we have accounts.
