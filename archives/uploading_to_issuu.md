# Uploading to Issuu

About a day or two before publication of a new issue, the layout editor (currently Da-Ye Shin and companyâ€”we love you) will send out a `.pdf` version of the to-be printed issue. Note that this is **not publically availible yet, but you can upload to issuu before release, with a delayed release.**

Here's how to do it.

1. Recieve the email with PDF from the current layout editor. Check the release date (it's on the front page of the paper)
2. Head over to issuu and log in. Username is stuyspecweb@gmail.com, password is not going to be written here. *Hint: eineg.*
3. Upload the issue by dragging the PDF to the window or using the uploader.
4. EDIT the metadata. We name issues using the convention "Volume ###, Issue #" (as of this writing, we're volume 104.
5. **IMPORTANT:** If the issue has not been released yet, change the release date to reflect that.
6. Make sure it's downloadable by clicking the box.
7. After uploading, you are going to add it to the propper stacks. We use stacks to organize the papers. It should either go in two or three stacks
    1. It will always go in the stack for it's volume. I.e., if it's in volume 105, put it in the stack called "Volume 105"
    2. It will always go in the hidden "archives" stack. That stack has all the issues in it, and is linked to the widget on the website.
    3. If the issue is from this year, put it in the hidden "current volume" stack. This is also linked to a widget on the website. This needs to be purged at the beginning of every new year.
8. If you followed these steps, you're all good :)
