# Physical Archives

Andrew, one of the old biz editors, has been trying to get those archives sorted and scanned for about four years. There are thousands and thousands of copies of the paper in the spec room, dating from the early 1930s to the most recent of issues.


**A number of hard copies of every print run should be saved for the archives**. After a few years, you can discard most of them, but always keep three (3) copies of an issue if possible.

Web doesn't really need to worry about them. I'm trying to get funds to get them professionally digitised and restored, but we will see how that goes.
