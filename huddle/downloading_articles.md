# Downloading Articles

1. In the workspace, head on over to the "Files" tab
2. At this point, you’ll see a bunch of folders for different Issues (We happen to have over 99, props to anyone that understands my bad and obscure humor) You should have already had an Issue assigned to you, so locate that one Screen
3. Once you’re in your Issue folder, there’s 4 things you gotta worry about. Art, Photo, SBC (Seen By Copy), and any documents that happen to be floating around in the bottom there. Screen Normally everything is organized into a folder, but occasionally you get those stragglers on the outside, like this Staff Ed. If they look like the kind of content you’d wanna put on the site, give ‘em a download.
4. Pretty much everything in the SBC folder is an article, so just download all of that.
5. Everything in Art should be a jpeg, so download all those too.
6. Photo is a bit more confusing. Generally there’s 3 folders (sometimes more, ask us about it if that happens), you should download the Color and Photoessay folders. We have a little more class than the printed paper, so there’s no need to get the black & whites.
7. Once you’ve got all that—this is just how I do it, you can do what you want.
    1. organize it all into a folder, and then
    2. make sure it’s all out of the zips. If you’re not familiar with .zip files, they’re just a lightly compressed version of a bunch of files. On Windows, just right-click it and hit “Extract All” to get a normal folder. Just double click for Mac.
